Thank you for considering contributing to our API integrations! Here's a detailed guide to help you submit new endpoints for us to integrate!

## Quick Guidelines
- **OpenAPI Version**: Stick to OpenAPI 3.x versions.
- **Character Limit**: Descriptions should be under 150 characters, and endpoint summaries should be kept under 500 characters.
- **Component References**: Component references are now allowed.

## Steps to Contribute
1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork this repository and clone your fork to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to integrations/**: Create or modify a YAML file in the `integrations/` directory.
3. **Define Your Endpoints**: Using the new YAML file, define your API endpoints. Remember to follow the quick guidelines.
4. **Validation**: Validate your YAML file against the OpenAPI 3.x specification. You can use the `validation_openapi.py` script locally to ensure compliance.
5. **Commit & Push**: Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Initiate a pull request from your fork to the main repository, and provide a summary of your changes.
